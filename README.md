# Includes files for paper "A quantum compiler design method by using linear combinations of permutations, A. Daskin, 2024"
The files are self explanatory, main.py can be used to generate random stochastic matrix and then decompose into a linear combination of permutations.
There are also functions to write permutations into disjoint cycles, etc.
bvn.py is for Birkhoff von Neuman  algorithm.
