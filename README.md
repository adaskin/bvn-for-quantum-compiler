# bistochastic-matrix-into-permutations
Includes files for paper "A quantum compiler design method by using linear combinations of permutations, A. Daskin, 2024".

The files are self explanatory, main.py can be used to generate random bistochastic matrix. There are also functions to write permutations into disjoint cycles, etc.
bvn.py is for Birkhoff von Neuman  algorithm  to decompose a doubly stochastic into a linear combination of permutations.
